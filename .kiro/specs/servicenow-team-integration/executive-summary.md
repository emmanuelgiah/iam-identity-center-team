## 📅 8-Week Delivery Plan

| Week | Deliverable |
|------|-------------|
| **Week 1** | Architecture + Customer POC Demo |
| **Weeks 2-4** | ServiceNow → TEAM integration + CLI testing |
| **Weeks 5-6** | Bidirectional sync + approval workflows |
| **Week 7** | CloudFormation deployment package |
| **Week 8** | Testing + Production go-live |

## 🚨 Critical Path Items

### Must Happen TODAY:
1. ✅ Approve $72K-$96K budget
2. ✅ Assign 3-4 engineers to project
3. ✅ Request ServiceNow dev instance access from Waters
4. ✅ Obtain TEAM API credentials

### Must Happen by Day 3-4:
- ✅ **Customer demo** showing working POC (ServiceNow → TEAM request creation)

## 🎯 MVP Scope (What's In)

✅ ServiceNow → TEAM request creation  
✅ TEAM → ServiceNow status updates (bidirectional)  
✅ Approval workflow synchronization  
✅ Session lifecycle tracking  
✅ CLI testing harness  
✅ CloudFormation deployment templates  
✅ Audit logging for compliance  

## ❌ Out of Scope (Future Phases)

❌ Custom ServiceNow UI (use standard forms)  
❌ Advanced reporting dashboards  
❌ Multi-region deployment  
❌ Custom notification templates

## ⚠️ Top 3 Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Customer demo in 3 days** | Build POC first, prioritize demo over perfection |
| **ServiceNow access delay** | Request TODAY, use mock API if needed |
| **Scope creep** | Lock MVP scope, document future enhancements |
