# ServiceNow-TEAM Integration Implementation

## Introduction

This project implements a bidirectional integration between ServiceNow and AWS IAM Identity Center TEAM (Temporary Elevated Access Management) application. The integration enables automated access request workflows, approval processes, and session management through ServiceNow's ITSM platform while maintaining TEAM's security controls and audit capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: ServiceNow Access Request Integration

**User Story:** As an end user, I want to request temporary elevated AWS access through ServiceNow's familiar interface, so that I can follow my organization's standard ITSM processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits an access request in ServiceNow THEN the system SHALL create a corresponding request in TEAM via API
2. WHEN creating a request THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields (account, permission set, duration, justification)
3. WHEN a request is submitted THEN the system SHALL return a unique request ID to ServiceNow
4. IF validation fails THEN the system SHALL return clear error messages to the user
5. WHEN a request is created THEN the system SHALL capture the ServiceNow ticket number for audit tracking

### Requirement 2: Approval Workflow Synchronization

**User Story:** As an approver, I want to review and approve/deny access requests in ServiceNow, so that I can use my existing approval workflows and dashboards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a TEAM request requires approval THEN the system SHALL create an approval task in ServiceNow
2. WHEN an approver acts on a ServiceNow approval THEN the system SHALL update the TEAM request status via API
3. WHEN approval status changes in TEAM THEN the system SHALL update the ServiceNow ticket status
4. WHEN multiple approvers are required THEN the system SHALL enforce the approval chain in both systems
5. IF an approval times out THEN both systems SHALL reflect the timeout status

### Requirement 3: Session Lifecycle Management

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want ServiceNow to reflect real-time session status from TEAM, so that I can monitor active elevated access sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a TEAM session is activated THEN the system SHALL update the ServiceNow ticket with session details
2. WHEN a session expires or is terminated THEN the system SHALL update the ServiceNow ticket status
3. WHEN viewing a ticket THEN users SHALL see current session status (pending, active, expired, terminated)
4. WHEN a session is active THEN the system SHALL display session start time, end time, and remaining duration
5. IF a session is terminated early THEN the system SHALL log the termination reason in ServiceNow

### Requirement 4: Audit Trail and Compliance Reporting

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want comprehensive audit logs of all access requests and approvals in ServiceNow, so that I can demonstrate compliance with security policies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any action occurs THEN the system SHALL log the action with timestamp, user, and details
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL include data from both ServiceNow and TEAM
3. WHEN an audit is performed THEN the system SHALL provide correlation between ServiceNow tickets and TEAM sessions
4. WHEN access is granted THEN the system SHALL record the business justification
5. IF suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL flag the ticket for review

### Requirement 5: Authentication and Authorization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure API authentication between ServiceNow and TEAM, so that only authorized systems can interact with the integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ServiceNow calls TEAM APIs THEN the system SHALL use OAuth 2.0 or API key authentication
2. WHEN credentials expire THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh tokens
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure and alert administrators
4. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL use TLS 1.2 or higher encryption
5. IF rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Resilience

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the integration to handle failures gracefully, so that temporary outages don't result in lost requests or inconsistent state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API call fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
2. WHEN retries are exhausted THEN the system SHALL log the error and notify administrators
3. WHEN ServiceNow is unavailable THEN TEAM SHALL continue to function independently
4. WHEN TEAM is unavailable THEN ServiceNow SHALL queue requests for later processing
5. IF data synchronization fails THEN the system SHALL provide manual reconciliation tools

### Requirement 7: Configuration and Customization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure integration settings without code changes, so that I can adapt the integration to organizational requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the integration THEN administrators SHALL be able to set API endpoints via UI
2. WHEN mapping fields THEN administrators SHALL be able to customize field mappings between systems
3. WHEN defining workflows THEN administrators SHALL be able to configure approval routing rules
4. WHEN setting policies THEN administrators SHALL be able to define access duration limits
5. IF configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL validate settings before applying

### Requirement 8: Notification and Alerting

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive notifications about my access requests through ServiceNow, so that I stay informed of request status changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request is submitted THEN the user SHALL receive a confirmation notification
2. WHEN a request is approved THEN the user SHALL receive an approval notification with access details
3. WHEN a request is denied THEN the user SHALL receive a denial notification with reason
4. WHEN a session is about to expire THEN the user SHALL receive a warning notification
5. IF a session is terminated THEN the user SHALL receive a termination notification

## Success Criteria

- Integration successfully processes 100% of access requests without data loss
- Average request processing time is under 30 seconds
- 99.9% uptime for the integration service
- Zero security incidents related to the integration
- Audit logs are complete and tamper-proof
- User satisfaction score of 4.5/5 or higher
