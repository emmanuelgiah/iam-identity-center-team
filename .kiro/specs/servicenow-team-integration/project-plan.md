## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Priority Risks

**Risk 1: API Rate Limiting**
- **Impact:** High
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Mitigation:** Implement caching, request queuing, and exponential backoff

**Risk 2: ServiceNow Upgrade Conflicts**
- **Impact:** High
- **Probability:** Low
- **Mitigation:** Use update sets, follow ServiceNow best practices, test on clone instance

**Risk 3: Authentication Token Expiry**
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Mitigation:** Implement automatic token refresh, monitoring, and alerting

**Risk 4: Data Synchronization Issues**
- **Impact:** High
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Mitigation:** Build reconciliation tools, implement idempotent operations

**Risk 5: Scope Creep**
- **Impact:** High
- **Probability:** High
- **Mitigation:** Strict change control process, prioritize MVP features
