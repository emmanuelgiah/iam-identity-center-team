## üö® Critical Decisions Needed Today

1. **Budget Approval:** Approve $72K-$96K budget (8-week timeline)?
2. **Team Assignments:** Who will be the technical leads? (Need 3-4 engineers)
3. **Timeline:** Is 8-week timeline acceptable? (Customer expects mid-next week demo)
4. **Scope:** MVP = Request creation + Approval sync + Session tracking (no UI)
5. **Authentication:** Cognito machine auth for ServiceNow ‚Üí TEAM API calls
6. **ServiceNow Access:** Can we get dev instance access from Waters by tomorrow?
7. **Identity Center Status:** Is Waters' Identity Center already configured?

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Top 5 Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| **ServiceNow Access Delay** | High | Medium | Request access TODAY, use mock API if delayed |
| **Identity Center Not Configured** | High | Medium | Confirm status with Waters, provide setup guide |
| **Customer Demo in 3 Days** | High | High | Build POC first, full features later |
| **Bidirectional Sync Complexity** | Medium | High | Use EventBridge + polling hybrid approach |
| **Scope Creep from Customer** | High | High | Lock MVP scope, document future enhancements |
